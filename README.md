This project in this repository is based on the manuscript “Deep Reinforcement Learning with Integer Optimization for Dynamic Slab Assignment Problem”, which has been accepted in IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology.

This project contains the the public source codes of our proposed algorithm (i.e., DRLIP), aiming to help reproduce the experimental results and facilitate potential studies. Moreover, the file “**Supplementary_Material.pdf**” contains the details of the implementation of the comparison methods and the corresponding experimental results.
